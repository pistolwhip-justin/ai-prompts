## Talking points

```txt
- Bidding extremely low because I am new to Freelancer.com and need the review more than the money, however I have been freelancing for over 7 years
- Please check my profile for my Upwork stats as well as my site URL and LinkedIn profile link to learn more about me
- I am an expert in creating automatons to make this process not only as efficient as possible but to also ensure the best product data somewhat
