Rudy's Diesel
Turbocharged Rudy's e-commerce engine, boosting sales and efficiency.


Year

Duration

Category

Rudy's e-commerce machine was sputtering, choked by a clunky BigCommerce setup that was bleeding resources faster than a ruptured oil tanker. Their product onboarding crawled like a snail on sedatives, and their SEO game was weaker than gas station coffee.

We kicked off by ditching the resource-guzzling BigCommerce for a lean, mean Shopify machine. Then we engineered a product-adding system so slick, it cut SKU onboarding time by a jaw-dropping 90%. This turbo boost tripled their product count, pumping up to over 500k SKUs.

But we didn't stop there. We overhauled their SEO, turning product descriptions into Google-pleasing gold. We automated order submissions to suppliers and tracking number retrieval, turning a manual mess into a smooth-running profit pipeline. To top it off, we built a Year-Make-Model data converter that would make a Swiss Army knife jealous.

The results? Hold onto your spreadsheets, folks. Sales exploded by 2.5x in just 3 months, with a 15% month-on-month growth that's still climbing. And here's the kicker – they're running this turbo-charged operation with 27% less time investment than before. Now that's what we call efficiency on steroids!


TerraPoint
Engineered TerraPoint's industry-disrupting TerraVerse, the eBay of big rigs and bulldozers.


Year

2023

Duration

10 weeks

TerraPoint was just another player in the heavy machinery market until we unleashed TerraVerse - a data-devouring beast that's turning the industry on its head. This digital Frankenstein scrapes over 30 major websites faster than a cheetah on Red Bull, consolidating new, used, and auction listings for everything from monster trucks to mega-dozers.

We didn't just build a website; we created a virtual colosseum where buyers and sellers duke it out in real-time. Bidding on TerraPoint? You're simultaneously throwing down on TruckPaper and dozens more. Selling? Post once and watch your listing spread like wildfire across the web.

The kicker? We did all this without asking for permission. It's like we threw a block party and invited the whole neighborhood - whether they liked it or not. The result? A one-stop-shop that's set to dominate the market faster than you can say "caterpillar."

Watch out, eBay. While you're cornering the market on grandma's Buick, TerraPoint is revving up to own the online heavy machinery world. It's not just disruption - it's a full-blown digital coup.


Capital Auto Parts
Dramatically improved CapAuto's inventory sync, catapulting sales into high gear.


Year

2024

Duration

6 weeks


CapAuto was stuck in the slow lane, their inventory updates crawling along like a rusty jalopy. With Shopify's API moving slower than a DMV line, it took a whopping 5 days to sync with 30+ suppliers. In the fast-paced world of auto parts, that's like trying to win NASCAR on a unicycle.

We rolled up our sleeves and engineered a solution that would make even Elon Musk jealous. By crafting a data-crunching behemoth that devoured historical inventory data and spat out turn-rate predictions, we slashed sync times from days to mere hours. Our custom GraphQL setup acted like a traffic cop on steroids, prioritizing updates for SKUs on the brink of stockouts.

This high-octane upgrade didn't just oil the gears - it strapped a rocket to CapAuto's chassis. They finally burst onto eBay and Amazon, their sales numbers accelerating faster than a supercar on nitro. We're talking a 5x revenue boost in just six months, from a modest $2.5 mil to a projected $15 mil annual haul.

Talk about zero to hero! This isn't just an upgrade - it's a full-blown transformation that's left the competition eating our digital dust. Who says you can't reinvent the wheel? We just did it for the entire inventory system!

about Me
Buckle up, tech trailblazers! You're about to meet the code-slinging, profit-pumping mastermind behind the digital curtain. By day, I'm a business efficiency ninja, turning clunky systems into sleek, money-making machines faster than you can say "ROI." I don't just build websites; I engineer digital ecosystems that work harder than a caffeinated squirrel on a wheel.

But when the sun sets on my laptop, you'll find me chasing adrenaline across the globe. From the dusty trails of Mexico to the emerald hills of Ireland, I'm a full-time adventurer with a penchant for anything on wheels. Catch me cycling through South American jungles, tearing up European backroads on a motorcycle, or conquering rugged terrain in a 4x4 in North America.

And when the day's adventures are done? You'll find me around a roaring bonfire, swapping tales with fellow nomads, with music booming or lush symphonic dreamscapes. Because life's too short for boring nights and slow data. So, ready to kick your business into high gear and maybe swap some travel stories? Let's ignite this digital revolution!
